# Sample Data

Sample data is provided for VIVO installations.

We have one sample data set.  It includes people, organizations, papers, grants, memberships, and other elements needed to demonstrate VIVO, and learn more about VIVO's approach to data representation.

In addition, we have data from [OpenVIVO](http://openvivo.org) and from [VIVO at the University of Florida](http://vivo.ufl.edu).  These are "real world" data sets.

## Instructions for use

For instructions, see "Sample Data" in the VIVO documentation https://wiki.duraspace.org/display/VIVODOC110x/Sample+Data
## Internationalization (i8n)

The `i18n` directory contains the internationalized version of the `sample-data.n3` graph and is distributed by linguistic context according to the following files:
* `sample-data.ttl` is the TURTLE copy of `sample-data.n3`.
* `sample-data-en_US.ttl` contains the U.S. English (`en_US`) labels of each resource contained in `sample-data.ttl`.
* `sample-data-fr_CA.ttl` contains the French Canadian (`fr_CA`) labels for each resource contained in `sample-data.ttl`.
